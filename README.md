JavaFX-CSS-Themes
=================

Create themes for JavaFX 2 applications using pure CSS. The goal: create themes for all major operating systems.

Hi all,

I'd like to build CSS themes for GUI controls for each major operating system. The goal is to make it
as easy as possible for developers to adjust color scheme. This relies heavily on the ladder and derive
functions in the CSS. 

This may take me a while so if you are interested please join!
